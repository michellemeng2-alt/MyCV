    <h2 id="bio">Professional Summary</h2>
    <p id="bio content">
      I am an IT Project Coordinator who connects business goals with technical results. With a Master’s degree in
      Enterprise IT Management, I specialize in taking complex ideas and turning them into clear project plans and
      visual prototypes. I am an expert at learning new software quickly and I use AI tools to work faster and more
      accurately. My focus is always on building flexible systems that can easily change as a business grows.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have extensive experience in the eCommerce industry, where I’ve managed updates to both the "front" of websites
      (what users see) and the "back" (the systems that run them). I’ve used A/B testing to enhance sales and
      Figma AI to quickly design new features. I don’t just coordinate tasks; I improve how teams work. For example,
      I’ve coordinated in creating Jira automation rules and internal ticketing systems that handled requests for entire
      companies, making the workflow much smoother for everyone involved.
      <br>
      <br>
      I enjoy making work more efficient and making sure developers and stakeholders are always on the same
      page. I am looking for a role where I can use my skills in automation, project management, and AI to help a
      forward-thinking company succeed.
